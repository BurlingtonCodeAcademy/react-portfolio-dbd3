                        My passion is solving unique problems in software that force me to grow and improve as a developer by balancing creativity and efficiency.

                        I am skilled with helping people less experienced than me in my past experiences as well as listening to those more experiences in order to further my growth.

                        Iâ€™m an enthusiastic fan of clever, simple solutions to complex problems that show the ability to make confusing problems accessible to everyone.

                        Other than these activities, I have taken care of over 5 dogs in my life and currently own 2 dogs at the moment. I've lived with animals throughout my life and plan to do so. Animals have
                        always been important to me as loyal companions. For two years I cared for my neighbor's pets during highschool by walking her dog and feeding her cat.

                        <li>Sailing: During the summer, I enjoy sailing in one-man boats called lasers. They are agile, smaller boats that are made for one person! Lake Mascoma is where I've sailed</li>
                        <li>Hiking: This is a common practice in places such as New Hampshire, but it is a fun activity that is always available if you enjoy long views from the mountains!</li>
                        <li>Competitive Gaming: I've participated in lan tournaments for games such as Apex Legends at my college in VTC along with other events that I have planned in the future!</li>
